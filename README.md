# Intermediate Git Concepts

## 1. `git push`
The `git push` command uploads local repository content to a remote repository. It's commonly used to share commits with others after committing locally.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Pushing changes to the default (origin) remote repository and branch
git push origin main

# Example 2: Pushing a specific branch to the remote
git push origin feature-branch

# Example 3: Force pushing to overwrite remote changes (use cautiously)
git push --force origin main
```
> **Scenario**: After making several commits locally, you use `git push` to send your updates to the main remote repository so others can pull them.

---

## 2. `git remote -v`
The `git remote -v` command shows the URLs of the remote repositories you're connected to. Useful to check where your repository is pushing or pulling from.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: List all remote connections
git remote -v

# Example 2: Adding a new remote and verifying it's listed
git remote add upstream https://github.com/other-repo.git
git remote -v

# Example 3: Checking remote URLs after cloning a repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
git remote -v
```
> **Scenario**: You want to check whether your repository is connected to the correct remote URLs before pushing changes.

---

## 3. `git push --force`
The `git push --force` command is used to forcefully push changes to a remote repository, potentially overwriting changes on the remote. Be cautious when using this.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Force push changes to the main branch
git push --force origin main

# Example 2: Force push a feature branch after a rebase
git rebase main
git push --force origin feature-branch

# Example 3: Force push with lease (safer version)
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
> **Scenario**: After rebasing your branch, you need to use `git push --force` to update the remote branch with your new commit history.

---

## 4. `git fetch`
The `git fetch` command downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working directory.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Fetching changes from the default remote (origin)
git fetch origin

# Example 2: Fetching changes from a specific branch
git fetch origin feature-branch

# Example 3: Fetching all remote branches
git fetch --all
```
> **Scenario**: You want to see updates from a remote branch without merging them into your local branch yet.

---

## 5. `git merge`
The `git merge` command integrates changes from one branch into another. Typically, it's used to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Merging a feature branch into the main branch
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

# Example 2: Merging changes from a remote-tracking branch
git checkout main
git merge origin/main

# Example 3: Resolving conflicts during a merge
git merge feature-branch
# If conflicts occur, resolve them in the files and then
git add <file>
git commit
```
> **Scenario**: After finishing a feature, you merge it into the main branch to make the new feature part of the production code.

---

## 6. `git rejected`
"Git rejected" errors often occur when your local branch and the remote branch diverge. This happens when your local branch has changes that the remote branch doesn't have.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Common rejected push error
git push origin main
# ! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)

# Example 2: Fetch and rebase to avoid rejection
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Example 3: Resolve by pulling the latest changes
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```
> **Scenario**: You try to push changes but encounter a "rejected" error because your local branch is behind the remote branch.

---

## 7. `git origin`
The `origin` in Git refers to the default remote repository when you clone or initialize a repository. It can be renamed or replaced.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Viewing the origin remote
git remote -v

# Example 2: Renaming the origin remote to upstream
git remote rename origin upstream

# Example 3: Adding a new origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-repo.git
```
> **Scenario**: You want to confirm or change the remote repository you're interacting with.

---

## 8. `git log`
The `git log` command displays the commit history of the current branch. Itâ€™s useful for reviewing changes, authors, and commit messages.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: View the basic commit history
git log

# Example 2: Viewing the log with one-line summaries
git log --oneline

# Example 3: Viewing the history for a specific file
git log -- <file-name>
```
> **Scenario**: You're reviewing the history of commits to track down when a bug was introduced.

---

## 9. `git fetch remote changes`
Fetching remote changes allows you to retrieve updates from a remote repository without integrating them.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Fetch all branches from the remote
git fetch origin

# Example 2: Fetch changes for a specific branch
git fetch origin feature-branch

# Example 3: Fetch and list branches updated remotely
git fetch --all
```
> **Scenario**: You want to see if anyone has pushed changes to the remote before updating your local branches.

---

## 10. Seeing what's merged to Git branch
You can check what commits have been merged into your current branch using `git log`.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Check for merged commits
git log --merges

# Example 2: Check if a specific branch has been merged
git branch --merged

# Example 3: Check whatâ€™s merged in relation to another branch
git log main..feature-branch --merges
```
> **Scenario**: Before deleting a branch, you check whether it has been fully merged into the main branch.

---

## 11. Creating branches
Creating branches allows you to work on features independently from the main codebase.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Example 2: Switch to an existing branch
git checkout main

# Example 3: List all branches
git branch
```
> **Scenario**: You create a new branch to work on a feature without affecting the main branch.

---

## 12. Git merge best practices
Merge best practices involve keeping your branches up to date and resolving conflicts properly.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Keep feature branches up-to-date before merging
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Example 2: Squashing commits before merging to clean up history
git merge --squash feature-branch

# Example 3: Merge using a pull request workflow
# Use PRs to review changes before merging.
```
> **Scenario**: Ensuring smooth merges by updating branches frequently and squashing commits for cleaner history.

---

## 13. `git merged` and `git no-merged`
Check which branches have been merged or not merged.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: List branches that have been merged into the current branch
git branch --merged

# Example 2: List branches that have NOT been merged
git branch --no-merged

# Example 3: Check merged state between specific branches
git log --merges main..feature-branch

# Example 4: Identify remote branches that were merged into the current branch
git branch -r --merged 
```
> **Scenario**: You verify if a branch can be safely deleted after confirming it has been merged.

---

## 14. `git prune`
The `git prune` command removes orphaned or unreachable objects in your repository. Itâ€™s commonly used to clean up deleted branches.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Remove orphaned objects after deleting branches
git prune

# Example 2: Prune remote-tracking branches that no longer exist
git fetch --prune

# Example 3: Dry run to see what would be pruned
git prune --dry-run

# Example 4: Prune a remote branch deleted by a team member
git remote prune origin
```
> **Scenario**: After deleting branches, you use `git prune` to clean up any remaining loose objects.

---

## 15. `git dry run`
The `git dry run` option allows you to simulate the outcome of a command without actually executing it.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Simulate a push command
git push --dry-run origin main

# Example 2: Simulate pruning objects
git prune --dry-run

# Example 3: Simulate deleting a branch
git branch -d feature-branch --dry-run
```
> **Scenario**: Before executing a potentially risky command, you run it with `--dry-run` to preview the outcome.

## 16. `git gc`
The `git gc` (garbage collection) command is used to clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local repository.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Run the default garbage collection
git gc

# Example 2: Aggressively clean up files and optimize the repository
git gc --aggressive

# Example 3: Simulate garbage collection to preview changes
git gc --dry-run
```
> **Scenario**: After deleting branches or performing many rebase operations, you run `git gc` to clean up unnecessary objects and optimize performance.

---

## 17. Creating tags with `git`
Tags are used to mark specific points in history, often used for releases or versioning.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Creating a lightweight tag for version 1.0
git tag v1.0

# Example 2: Tagging a specific commit
git tag v1.0 <commit-sha>

# Example 3: Listing all tags in the repository
git tag
```
> **Scenario**: Youâ€™re ready to release version 1.0 of your project, and you create a tag to mark the commit.

---

## 18. Creating annotated tags with `-am`
Annotated tags contain additional metadata like the taggerâ€™s name, email, and date, along with a message. They are used when more detailed version tracking is required.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Creating an annotated tag with a message
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"

# Example 2: Creating an annotated tag for a specific commit
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Hotfix for issue #42" <commit-sha>

# Example 3: Verifying the details of an annotated tag
git show v1.0
```
> **Scenario**: Youâ€™re preparing a formal release and want to add extra details about whatâ€™s included in the release via an annotated tag.

---

## 19. Deleting tags
Tags can be deleted locally and remotely when no longer needed.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Deleting a local tag
git tag -d v1.0

# Example 2: Deleting a remote tag
git push origin --delete v1.0

# Example 3: Delete multiple local tags at once
git tag -d v1.0 v1.1 v1.2
```
> **Scenario**: You made a mistake with a tag name or need to remove an old version tag from both the local and remote repositories.

---

## 20. `git switch`
`git switch` is an alternative to `git checkout` for switching branches, with a clearer syntax for branch switching.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Switch to an existing branch
git switch main

# Example 2: Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c feature-branch

# Example 3: Switch to a remote-tracking branch
git switch origin/feature-branch
```
> **Scenario**: You're working on multiple branches and want to quickly switch between them using a simpler syntax.

---

## 21. `git SHA`
The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) in Git is a unique identifier for every commit. It helps track specific commits and allows for precise referencing.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Viewing the SHA for recent commits
git log --oneline

# Example 2: Checkout a commit using its SHA
git checkout <commit-sha>

# Example 3: Referencing a commit SHA in a tag
git tag v2.0 <commit-sha>
```
> **Scenario**: You need to revert your working directory to a specific commit identified by its SHA.

---

## 22. `git --tags`
The `git --tags` option is used with commands to include tags in their output.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Fetch tags from the remote repository
git fetch --tags

# Example 2: List all commits including tags
git log --tags

# Example 3: Push tags to the remote repository
git push --tags
```
> **Scenario**: You want to ensure that tags are included when fetching changes or listing commit history.

---

## 23. Why and when to create tags
Tags are useful for marking significant points in a repository's history, like release versions or milestones.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Tagging a release version
git tag v1.0

# Example 2: Creating a tag for a milestone in development
git tag milestone-1

# Example 3: Annotating a tag for better version tracking
git tag -a v2.0 -m "Major release with new features"
```
> **Scenario**: When you release a new version of your project, creating a tag makes it easier to track that specific point in history.

---

## 24. Listing tags with `git tag`
The `git tag` command lists all tags created in the repository.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: List all tags in the repository
git tag

# Example 2: List tags that match a pattern (e.g., version numbers)
git tag -l "v*"

# Example 3: Show details of a specific tag
git show v1.0
```
> **Scenario**: Before releasing a new version, you check the existing tags to ensure there are no duplicate version numbers.

---

## 25. Pushing tags to a remote repository
Pushing tags ensures that they are available on the remote repository for collaboration and version tracking.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Pushing a specific tag
git push origin v1.0

# Example 2: Pushing all tags to the remote repository
git push --tags

# Example 3: Pushing annotated tags to the remote
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Annotated release" <commit-sha>
git push origin v1.1
```
> **Scenario**: After tagging a release locally, you push the tags to the remote so collaborators can reference the release.

---

## 26. Fetching tags with `git fetch`
Fetching tags retrieves them from the remote repository without affecting your local branches.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Fetching all tags from the remote
git fetch --tags

# Example 2: Fetch specific tags (if configured for specific branches)
git fetch origin refs/tags/v1.0

# Example 3: Fetch and merge changes including tags
git fetch --all --tags
```
> **Scenario**: A collaborator pushed new tags, and you fetch them to keep your local repository up to date with the latest version markers.

---

## 27. `git -n`
The `-n` option simulates or previews actions without making changes. It can be useful for certain commands to avoid accidental execution.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Preview push changes
git push -n origin main

# Example 2: Simulate branch deletion without actual removal
git branch -d feature-branch -n

# Example 3: Preview rebasing without applying changes
git rebase -n origin/main
```
> **Scenario**: You want to see what will happen when running a push or branch deletion before executing it.

---

## 28. `git -l`
The `-l` option is typically used with listing commands to format the output or filter results.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: List all branches
git branch -l

# Example 2: List tags with specific formatting
git tag -l "v*"

# Example 3: List files in the repository
git ls-files -l
```
> **Scenario**: You need a more specific output from Git commands, like when filtering branches or tags.

---

## 29. `git HEAD`
`HEAD` is a reference to the current commit or the tip of the current branch. It is commonly used for checking out specific states or reverting to previous states.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Viewing the commit pointed to by HEAD
git show HEAD

# Example 2: Resetting to the previous commit (HEAD^)
git reset --hard HEAD^

# Example 3: Checking out the latest commit
git checkout HEAD
```
> **Scenario**: You want to return to the state of the last commit or investigate the most recent changes in the branch.

---

## 30. `git diff`
The `git diff` command shows changes between commits, branches, or working directory and staged changes.

### Code Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: Showing unstaged changes in the working directory
git diff

# Example 2: Comparing differences between two branches
git diff main feature-branch

# Example 3: Viewing changes between a commit and the working directory
git diff <commit-sha>
```
> **Scenario**: After making changes, you want to see the difference between your current state and the last commit or another branch.
